                            <p>During the height of the pandemic, I continued my studies at UCT by qualifying as a high school teacher. I specialised with the following subjects:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Senior Phase (Grade 7-9):</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Mathematics</li>
                                    <li>Natural Sciences</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Further Education and Training (Grade 10-12):</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Mathematical Literacy</li>
                                    <li>Life Sciences</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ol>
                            <p>My experience in this course was incredibly valuable. I will admit that I struggled a fair amount, but it gave me many good  insights into my own character and what I am actually capable of.</p>

                            <p>I was exposed to programming during my first year of my B.Sc degree. I learnt some basics back then, but the core logic and principles stuck with me throughout the years. After some time job hunting and recovering from post-pandemic and -university burnout, I decided to pursue a qualification in programming and that has been the best idea for me so far.</p>

                            <p>I have been house sitting on and off for a number of years. It started as mostly for family friends, but in the past year or two I have garnered a number of repeat customers that I have no relationship to. This experience has shown me to be capable, responsible and reliable. People can and do trust me with their homes and pets (which are, in some cases, equivalent to children for them) without stressing and worrying about the state they will find them in on their return.</p>

                            <h5>2020-present</h4>
                            <p>There has always been a passion in my life for producing tasty treats for friends and family. I was encouraged to sell my goods a few years ago and since then I have been running a side business I like to call "Bakers Blocq". I run an Instagram page for it (linked in the <a>Contact</a> section down below) and have received many orders over the years. I explored some employment opportunities in this field and even did a paid trial at a restaurant called Shawarma Express baking pita bread. I enjoyed it a lot, but realised that I enjoyed my passion too much to risk becoming reliant on it and potentially resenting it in the future.</p>
                            
                            <p>By exploring this avenue and running my own side business, I developed a knack for producing consistent quality goods and discovering exactly what design a customer wants for their product.</p>
